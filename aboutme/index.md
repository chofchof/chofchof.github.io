- Python, C, Mathematica << Programming Languages

I'm working on **Mathematics for Industry** at ICIM.

- Springer series, [Mathematics for Industry](http://www.springer.com/series/13254) says:

   > The meaning of “Mathematics for Industry” (sometimes abbreviated as MI or MfI) is different from that of “Mathematics in Industry” (or of “Industrial Mathematics”).
     The latter is restrictive: it tends to be identified with the actual mathematics that specifically arises in the daily management and operation of manufacturing.
     The former, however, denotes a new research field in mathematics that may serve as a foundation for creating future technologies.
     This concept was born from the integration and reorganization of pure and applied mathematics in the present day into a fluid and versatile form capable of stimulating awareness of the importance of mathematics in industry, as well as responding to the needs of industrial technologies.
     The history of this integration and reorganization indicates that this basic idea will someday find increasing utility.
     Mathematics can be a key technology in modern society.
